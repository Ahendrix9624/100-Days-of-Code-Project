>This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 

**except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 

**unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

e.g. The year 2000:

2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)

2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
