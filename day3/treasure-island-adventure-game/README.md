I am challenging myself to learn python and code for 100 days making small projects along the way. Just like going to the gym is great for you physcial health. Problem solving through coding and creating something out of nothing is great for your mind's health. 

the_boring_way.py file is just another way to write the same code. This code is from the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy by Dr. Angela.

The other .py file is how I created the program before seeing how she created it. In the end the programs are similar. One is my code and one is Dr. Angela's.
