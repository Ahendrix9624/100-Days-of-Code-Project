## How it works
```plain text
1. Run it.
2. Wait 3 seconds for the card to flip over to the back.
3. If you guessed the answer correctly, click the green checkmark. The card will be removed from the current rotation.
4. If you guessed incorrectly, click the red checkmark. The card will remain in the current rotation and be saved to a file called "data/words_to_learn.csv".
5. Your progress will be automatically saved when you exit the program.
